# Django

in Day-06 and Day-07 i use csrf tokens 

Here csrf_tokens means A CSRF token (Cross-Site Request Forgery token) is a security mechanism used to protect web applications from CSRF attacks. In a CSRF attack, a malicious website or script tricks a user into performing unwanted actions on a different website where the user is authenticated.
